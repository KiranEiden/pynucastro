# changes since the last release

# 1.5.0

  -- Added gridplot function for plotting nuclides on a grid and
     coloring the cells by X, Y, Xdot, Ydot or activity

  -- Created a notebook and a script for generating rp-process
     networks. The script allows an arbitrary endpoint to be specified.

  -- Added a filter_function option to RateFilter and to the plotting
     functions that allows for filtering rates or nuclei using a
     user-defined Boolean map.

  -- Fixed a write_network crash if the RateCollection contains
     multiple rates with the same name.
     
  -- Deleted unused BLAS and VODE files previously used for the standalone
     Fortran outputs. These have been deprecated in favor of the StarKiller
     Microphysics network output as of v1.3.0.

# 1.4.1

  -- Improvements for locating rate files in directories also containing python scripts or Jupyter notebooks
  -- Fixed a warning when using Numba
  -- Updates to the StarKiller Microphysics format for compile time variables
  -- Enhancements for the RateCollection Explorer to use NetworkX 2.5
  -- Updated the requirements

# 1.4.0

  -- Added general support for tabulated weak rates from Suzuki, et al. 2016
  -- Added a simple pp network example
  -- Updated StarKiller Microphysics output to track latest changes in Microphysics network API
  -- Added a core developers policy in the Readme

# 1.3.0

  -- Replace double precision reals in StarKiller networks with custom real type `_rt`
  -- Incorporate modifications to thermal neutrino Jacobian contributions from Microphysics (#210) in StarKiller networks
  -- Simplify rate evaluation code in StarKiller networks
  -- Deprecated standalone Fortran output with VODE integration.
  -- BaseFortranNetwork is now an abstract class to require users to either use StarKillerNetwork or provide templates

# 1.2.0

  -- Fix tabular rate bug where electron chemical potential contributions were not included
  -- Update documentation and code comments
  -- Add Numba support for Python networks
  -- Enable sparse Jacobian (CSR) for StarKiller networks
  -- Incorporate CUDA Fortran port for StarKiller networks including tabulated rates
  -- Optimize rate screening evaluation for StarKiller networks
  -- Fix bug to include the electron fraction and correct density dependence for Reaclib electron capture rates
  -- Allow a nuclide to be both reactant and product
  -- Updates an error message for multiple degenerate rates
  -- Add example code generating a 160-isotope network
  -- Fix table compilation issue for StarKiller networks
  -- Moved energy generation subroutine into RHS module for StarKiller networks
